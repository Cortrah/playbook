in this one we sent 3 dds myself old dude and sypher to a and everybody else to c

They sent a des moines and a dd (a Khab?) to b

Cypher and old dude killed the dd, and the des moines went back to c

then everybody at c was dead and we tried to defend a and b
I tried to help with distractions like early smoke at c and distracting the des, but in the end I wasn't much help
