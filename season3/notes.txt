Setting up Replays

You can do it manually but there is a mod to make the changes as well.

When installing the mods you need to be sure it's a version that matches the current client version

The replay filename conventions varys a bit from the map names

Warriors Path = Path_warrior
Hotspot = OC_bees_to_honey
Sleeping Giant = Sleeping_Giant
Mountain Range = ridge
Tears of the Desert = naval_mission
Sea of Fortune = sea_hope
