Grecco crashes
Felix and I are going to c
Tim CD and others are defending A against a yuyang and others
THey are blitzed while we try to take c
defend well and we cap
grecco is back in
felix and I come back to b
cd and one of their des go down
moskova appears and radars us
we lose tim, me and felix have good torps on the moskova and conguerer,
I make the mistake of shooting once or twice drawing attentin instead of waitng for my torps
I have a spread lined up perfectly and get shot once injuring my torpedo tubes
try to get away but they get another radar and I ground myself, burn and die
we melt down quickly
felix gets two on the moskova and tries to smoke but goes down at the same time as old dude
